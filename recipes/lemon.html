    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A worldwide favourite, Chinese Lemon Chicken is loved by many because of the flavours and texture you get in every mouthful. Whether itâ€™s the tangy lemon sauce or the crispy chicken breast pieces, good take-out is hard to find. This is why having your own recipe is just as important as having a take-out menu in your kitchen.

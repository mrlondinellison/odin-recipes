    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="text">
        Similar to the stuff you buy in a can, but so much better and still crazy fast. This hearty bowl of macaroni and beef in tomato sauce is sure to become a new family favorite in your house too. It has just a hint of spice, with enough to taste it, but not too much for those picky eaters. So it's totally kid-friendly. Just cook some elbow noodles (even gluten free, if needed), brown some ground beef, and add some sauce and chili powder. It doesn't get any easier!
